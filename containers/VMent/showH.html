		Do you have videos or pictures that you just want to share with your friends? Do you want them to comment in the <em>exact</em> second they made the comment on the video? Do you want them to doodle all over the video or picture as well?
		<div id="huge">You are on the right track!</div>
  VMENT is a great social network in which you can annotate pictures and videos!
