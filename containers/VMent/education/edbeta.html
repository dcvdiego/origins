So you want your school to use more technology? Are you a guy who needs help which no human you know can give you(or you are just simply dying for knowledge)?<br>
	Maybe you are even a person who is willing to share their knowledge!<br>
	This and more at no cost, is what VMENTEd will help you on.<br>
