# Origins
A website about the code/projects I found that I wrote as an aficionado, before getting into programming professionally.

These websites will be hosted soon, they are currently being reformatted so that they work with current versions.

These are the steps I am taking to finish this project:

1. Fix code so that all websites work 

2. Add some sort of commentary overlay as people wander through the pages to explain my code and my thoughts almost 10 years ago!

3. Deployment and somewhat regular management!
